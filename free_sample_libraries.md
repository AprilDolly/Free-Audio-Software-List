## Electric Guitar

### Soft Ibanez

"I was really curious to know what could happen if I was to grab my Ibanez RG guitar, program a clean sound on my pedal board and record… so I did it. I wish I had a room mic to get all the reverb of my room, but since I just couldn’t do it that way, I captured an impulse/response and used a convolution plugin to recreate a fake room mic."

Format: SFZ
