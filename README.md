## Visualization

### EasySSP

Easy Sound Space Perception is a small and lightweight audio visualization tool, which currently provides spectrometer and goniometer views. The main advantage of this tool is that it can render information about up to four stereo pairs at the same time onto the same surface using different colors (see screenshots).
